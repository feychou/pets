# Pets

A simple CR(UD) app created with react and json-server

## Install and run

```
npm install
npm run start-json-server
```

On a new terminal window `npm start`

The react app should be running on http://localhost:3001
The json server should be running on http://localhost:3000 and its starting available route is `/pets`

Have fun!
